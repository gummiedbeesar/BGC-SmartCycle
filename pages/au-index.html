        <p class="wisc-p"> Millions of trash is thrown into landfills everyday. It makes people sick, pollutes the
          earth, and is a great contributor to climate change. This needs to end. So many things that are simply being
          tossed into the trash can be recycled, but not many people know what to do.</p>
        <p class="wisc-p"> SmartCycle is a tool to promote sustainability by empowering students with the knowledge to
          reduce the volume of and demand for materials that create the biggest waste footprint.</p>
        <p class="wisc-p"> Recycling is very important for the environment. What happens if we don't stop? The more
          pollution the worse global warming will become.</p>
        <p class="wisc-p"> Recycling can be a little complicated for some people so we are working on something to help
          them get educated and excited about it.</p>
        <p class="wisc-p"> We plan to inspire the younger generation to protect and save the planet.</p>
