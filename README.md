# How to run a React app

ReactJS is a Javascript library or framework used to build modular user interfaces. [Read more here](https://reactjs.org/).

## Prerequisites
1. Node (npm)
2. Some IDE (visual studio code)
3. Basic HTML, JS knowledge

<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps to run this project:


1. You want to open your `terminal` and navigate to this folder.
    * On mac this is `terminal`, but on a windows machine, this will be your `command line`
    ```
    cd bgc-hackathon
    ```
2. Install the node_modules
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the project
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
